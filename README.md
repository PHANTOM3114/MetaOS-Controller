A powerful, cross-platform remote controller and system management hub, designed to be the core component of the MetaOS ecosystem. This project provides a gRPC-based API for remote procedure calls to manage and monitor a host system.

## üåü Core Idea & Philosophy

The goal of this project is to create a robust, secure, and efficient tool for system-level automation and remote management. It's built with performance and extensibility in mind, serving as a foundational piece for more ambitious projects.

## ‚ú® Features (Planned & In-Progress)

The controller is designed to manage the following system components via its gRPC API:

* **üñ•Ô∏è System & Process Management:**
    * [ ] Remotely execute shell scripts and commands.
    * [ ] Manage system processes (start, stop, monitor).
    * [ ] System shutdown and reboot.
    * [ ] *[–î–æ–¥–∞–π —Å—é–¥–∏ —Å–≤–æ—ó —ñ–Ω—à—ñ —ñ–¥–µ—ó]*

* **üåê Network & VPN Control:**
    * [ ] Manage system-level VPN connections (e.g., OpenVPN, WireGuard).
    * [ ] Switch between connection profiles.
    * [ ] Monitor network status.
    * *...*

* **‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD & Developer Tooling:**
    * [ ] Listen for CI/CD pipeline events (via WebSockets or other means).
    * [ ] Trigger local actions based on build statuses.
    * *...*

* **üé¨ Real-time Streaming (Experimental / Future):**
    * [ ] Screen/window streaming using WebRTC.
    * [ ] Remote input handling (mouse, keyboard).
    * *...*

*You can add more components you plan to control here...*

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Language:** C++20
* **RPC Framework:** gRPC
* **Serialization:** Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)
* **Build System:** CMake
* **Testing:** GoogleTest

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following tools and libraries installed on your system:
* CMake (version 3.20 or higher)
* A modern C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
* gRPC and Protocol Buffers libraries
    * *On macOS (example): `brew install grpc protobuf`*
    * *On Ubuntu (example): `sudo apt-get install libgrpc++-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler-grpc`*

### Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git)
    cd YourRepo
    ```

2.  **Configure CMake and build the project:**
    ```sh
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

## üèÉ Usage

Once built, you can run the server and interact with it using a client.

**Run the server:**
```sh
./build/server
```

**Interact with a client (e.g., `grpcurl` for testing):**
```sh
# Example of running a shell script
grpcurl -plaintext \
        -d '{"command": "echo Hello from my controller!"}' \
        localhost:50051 \
        MetaOS.MetaControl/RunShellScriptRequest
```
*Further examples of client usage will be added here.*

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

* [ ] Finalize core API for process and script management.
* [ ] Implement robust VPN management logic.
* [ ] Set up a fully working CI/CD pipeline with automated tests.
* [ ] Begin research and development for the screen streaming feature.
* See the open issues for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
