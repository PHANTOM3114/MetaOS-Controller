A powerful, cross-platform remote controller and system management hub, designed to be the core component of the MetaOS ecosystem. This project provides a gRPC-based API for remote procedure calls to manage and monitor a host system.

## üåü Core Idea & Philosophy

This controller is a part of the much more bigger project - MetaOS. Controller has a set of features for controlling your linux pc remotely, its not an Anydesk, but more specific.

## ‚ú® Features (Planned & In-Progress)

The controller is designed to manage the following system components via its gRPC API:

* **üñ•Ô∏è System & Process Management:**
    * [ ] Remotely execute shell scripts and commands.
    * [ ] Manage system processes (start, stop, monitor).
    * [ ] System shutdown and reboot.
    * [ ] *[–î–æ–¥–∞–π —Å—é–¥–∏ —Å–≤–æ—ó —ñ–Ω—à—ñ —ñ–¥–µ—ó]*

* **üåê Network & VPN Control:**
    * [ ] Manage system-level VPN connections (e.g., OpenVPN, WireGuard).
    * [ ] Switch between connection profiles.
    * [ ] Monitor network status.
    * *...*

* **‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD & Developer Tooling:**
    * [ ] Listen for CI/CD pipeline events (via WebSockets or other means).
    * [ ] Trigger local actions based on build statuses.
    * *...*

* **üé¨ Real-time Streaming (Experimental / Future):**
    * [ ] Screen/window streaming using WebRTC.
    * [ ] Remote input handling (mouse, keyboard).
    * *...*

*You can add more components you plan to control here...*

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Language:** C++20
* **RPC Framework:** gRPC
* **Serialization:** Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)
* **Build System:** CMake
* **Testing:** GoogleTest

*Further examples of client usage will be added here.*

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

* [ ] Finalize core API for process and script management.
* [ ] Implement robust VPN management logic.
* [ ] Set up a fully working CI/CD pipeline with automated tests.
* [ ] Begin research and development for the screen streaming feature.
* See the open issues for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
